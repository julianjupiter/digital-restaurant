## Microservices / REST / AxonServer
#### :octocat: /drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-monolith-rest-2 :octocat:

*This is a thin layer which coordinates the application activity. It does not contain business logic. It does not hold the state of the business objects*

We designed and structured our [loosely coupled components](../../drestaurant-libs) in a modular way, 
and that enable us to choose different deployment strategy and take first step towards Microservices architectural style.

Each microservice:

 - has its own bounded context,
 - has shared event(sourcing) storage (AxonServer)
 - and we route and distribute messages (`events`, `commands`, `queries`) between them via [AxonServer](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server)

This a second version (2.2) of the `REST Microservices application` in which we use AxonServer as an infrastructural component.
 
#### AxonServer & event messages & command messages & query messages

Both [AxonFramework](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-framework) and [AxonServer](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server) form an [Axon platform](https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/).


The key characteristics of [AxonServer](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server) are:
 - Dedicated infrastructure for exchanging three types of messages (`commands`, `events`, `queries`) in a message-driven micro-services environment
 - Purpose-built database system optimized for the storage of event data of the type that is generated by applications that use the event sourcing architecture pattern
 - Built-in knowledge on CQRS message patterns
 - Easy-to-use and easy-to-manage

AxonServer connector is configured by default (included in `axon-spring-boot-starter`) :

 ```
 <dependency>
     <groupId>org.axonframework</groupId>
     <artifactId>axon-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
     <version>${axon.version}</version>
 </dependency>

 ```

Alternatively, you can exclude AxonServer connector and fallback to JPA event store and storage in general.
In that case you have to choose (and configure, and operate) Spring Cloud to distribute `commands`, and Kafka or RabbitMQ to distribute `events`.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.axonframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>axon-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.axonframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>axon-server-connector</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

We did this already in the [first version](../drestaurant-microservices-rest) of 'REST Microservices application' as a proof that you can benefit from AxonFramework programming model only (without AxonServer as an infrastructural component).
[first version](../drestaurant-microservices-rest) is using:
  - RabbitMQ to distribute events between microservices
  - Spring Cloud discovery and registry service (Eureka) to distribute commands between microservices
  - no out of the box option to distribute queries -> each microservice has `command` and `query` side component included -> there is no independent `query` microservice -> you can not scale good

AxonFramework programing model is recognizing three categories of messages at the moment:
 - commands
 - events
 - queries

and they require different mechanisms of routing and distributing. AxonServer is built with this in mind, and you should consider it as an important tactical asset in you architecture. This will enable you to focus on your domain model and strategic design.

AxonFramework and AxonServer are `open source`. [Axon Server Enterprise](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-enterprise) is targeted towards mission-critical, medium to large scale production deployments of Axon.
